    <b><p>About Snek</p></b>
    <b><a href="https://github.com/ashtheamin/backups/tree/main/snek">Source Code</a></b>
    <p>Use the WASD keys to move the snek around. You are not allowed to bump into your own body or a wall, if you do, your game is over.</p>
    <p>Collect as much food as you can, which makes your snek grow in length. Your end goal is to get your snek as long as possible.</p>
    <p>This game was written in C with SDL for the graphics backend, and was ported to the browser in webassembly with emscripten.</p>
